# 🛠️ HustleCodex ML Toolkit

## 🛡️ Core Internal Tool Status
This repository has been elevated from a fork to a **Core Internal Tool** within the HustleCodex ecosystem. It serves as the primary machine learning infrastructure layer, providing optimized environments for AI agent orchestration and data analysis.

## 🚀 Integration Role
The **HustleCodex ML Toolkit** is specifically tuned for integration with:
- **HustleCodex Platform**: Provides the backend ML processing power for user data analysis.
- **AI Agent Taskforce**: Serves as the execution environment for specialized ML agents.
- **Manus AI Integration**: Acts as the bridge for high-performance computing tasks assigned to Manus agents.

## 📦 Features
- **Optimized Environments**: Pre-configured setups for Ubuntu 22.04 and 20.04.
- **Modern Stack**: Includes Node.js 20.x for full compatibility with **HustleCodeX v2.0.0** (Next.js 15.5+).
- **NVIDIA Support**: Tailored driver configurations for H100, A100, and legacy GPU hardware.

## 🛠️ Usage in HustleCodex
This toolkit is invoked during the \`/run ML-Box\` command sequence to:
1. Initialize a secure, high-performance ML sandbox.
2. Process HustleCodex datasets using automated machine learning (MLBox).
3. Return predictive insights (e.g., Revenue Potential) to the orchestration layer.

## 🛡️ Decision Record: Documentation Elevation
- **Decision**: Rebranded repository from \`ml-in-a-box\` fork to \`hustlecodex-ml-toolkit\`.
- **Reasoning**: To reflect the significant local modifications and its critical role in the HustleCodex financial freedom pathway.
- **Outcome**: Clearer project identity and improved documentation for developers and AI agents interacting with the toolkit.

## 💡 Strategic Pathway
